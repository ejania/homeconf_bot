# TODO

- [x] **Rename `/cancel` to `/unregister`**: Update the command name and all internal references to improve clarity.
- [x] **Add Guest Support for Speakers**: Implement a feature allowing users in the speakers group to add guests to the event registration.
- [x] **Restrict Commands to Private Chat**: Prohibit user commands in group chats to avoid spam; ensure the bot only responds to registration-related commands in DMs.
- [x] **Polished User Messages**: Rewrite all user-facing bot responses to be more welcoming, polite, and professionally phrased.
